# Surfs-Up

## Analysis Overview
After taking a trip to hawaii, we came up with the idea of opening up a surf shop that will also serve ice cream. We contacted an investor friend of ours who is interested in helping with funding but wants to ensure success by looking at weather trends since both ice cream and surfing businesses correlate heavily with weather. Using a weather database and analytical tools, our goal was to find a good location that would maximize business.


## Results
Using the mentioned database, statistical summary tables for temperatures in Hawaii in June and December were generated. See these tables below

![December Temps](https://github.com/tyler-sanzo/Surfs-up/blob/main/Resources/December_Temps.PNG)

- Despite the season difference, we can see that the average temperatures for both June and December would be very suitable for surfing and ice cream. Average temperatures are within 4 degrees of each other so no matter what time of year we can be confident that business would be consistent.

- Data distribution is near normal as both months' mean and median temperatures are within a degree of each other, respectively.

- The data count for both June and December are large enough that we can be confident in the temperature statistics being accurate and meaningful.


## Analysis Summary

While the temperature summary gave us some confidence in the success of our business, we wanted to complete the analysis of the weather by checking precipitation statistics. Using the same methods, we extracted rainfall data to generate the tables below.

![December Rain](https://github.com/tyler-sanzo/Surfs-up/blob/main/Resources/December_Prcp.PNG)


As we can see, the average precipitation in both months is relatively low. Using both weather statistics gives us great confidence that our business will be successful year round.
